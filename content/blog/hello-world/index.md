Honestly, I haven't seen the need to contribute or "push" anything publicly ever because: 
1.  I didn't see the point what with over 7 billion people on the planet surely someone else can speak up, and;
2.  I didn't value myself, my points of view or my voice as being important in any way 
3.  Fear, which probably should be number 1. 

But, there are problems in the world today ranging from global warming to corruption to social engineering which are not actively discussed in the MSM or by the general public, possibly revealing how journalism is dead and died some time ago when money came to play...

But at the end of the day, the purpose of this blog site realistically is a place to share my thoughts, feelings, research in the hopes of inspiring you the reader to engage with your friends/family/colleagues in discussing some of these topics. 

Where I'm not discussing some of the BHMPs (Big Hairy Monster Problems) I'll probably be voicing my opinion on something programming related.

I'll try my best to write something weekly but no promises, *I am kinda busy* :P
